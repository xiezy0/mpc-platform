Trying to run 128-bit computation
The following timing is inclusive preprocessing.
Time = 111.231 seconds 
Data sent = 18777.9 MB in ~244572 rounds (party 1)
Global data sent = 37555.8 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'svm.mpc':
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(2)
