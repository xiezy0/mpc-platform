Using security parameter 40
Trying to run 128-bit computation
Significant amount of unused triples of Z2^128. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with -b.
The following timing is inclusive preprocessing.
Time = 0.382037 seconds 
Data sent = 33.0395 MB in ~524 rounds (party 1)
Global data sent = 66.0791 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'dynamic_function.mpc':
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_split(2)
