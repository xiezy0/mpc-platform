Significant amount of unused triples of SPDZ gfp. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with -b.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 2.97255 seconds 
Data sent = 196.138 MB in ~2441 rounds (party 0)
Global data sent = 392.276 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'tutorial.mpc':
	program.use_edabit(True)
